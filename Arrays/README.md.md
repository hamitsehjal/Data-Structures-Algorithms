1. Subarray
A subarray is a contiguous portion of an array (elements must be consecutive). Think of it as taking a slice of the array while maintaining the original order.

2. Prefix
A prefix is a subarray that starts from the first element of the original array. It includes all elements from the beginning up to any position.

3. Subset
A subset is any collection of elements from the array, regardless of order or position. Elements can be chosen from anywhere in the array, and order doesn't matter.

4. Subsequence
A subsequence is similar to a subset, but it must maintain the relative order of elements from the original array (though elements don't need to be consecutive).
