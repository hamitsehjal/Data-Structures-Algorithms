# Heaps

- whenever, you have to find min/max of something repeatedly, consider using `Heap` (Priority Queue)
-

## Two Heaps Pattern
Okay, let's dive into the **Two Heaps** pattern, a useful technique for solving certain types of coding interview problems, especially those involving medians or maintaining order statistics in dynamic datasets. We'll use Python for the explanations and code examples.

**What is the Two Heaps Pattern?**

The core idea is to maintain two heaps (priority queues) to divide a set of numbers into two parts:

1.  **Max-Heap:** Stores the _smaller_ half of the numbers. Its root element is the largest number in the smaller half.
2.  **Min-Heap:** Stores the _larger_ half of the numbers. Its root element is the smallest number in the larger half.

The key is to keep these two heaps balanced such that they effectively represent the sorted version of the numbers without actually sorting the entire list repeatedly.

**Why Use Two Heaps?**

This structure gives you efficient access to the elements around the "middle" of the dataset.

-   If the total number of elements is **odd**, the median is the top element of the heap that has one extra element (usually we keep the max-heap larger by one).
-   If the total number of elements is **even**, the median is the average of the top elements of both heaps.

**Python Implementation Detail:**

Python's `heapq` module only provides a _min-heap_. To simulate a _max-heap_, we store the _negatives_ of the numbers in a min-heap. When we need the maximum value, we retrieve the smallest element (the root) and negate it back.

**When to Use It / How to Identify Problems:**

Look for problems where you need to:

1.  **Find the Median:** Especially in a stream of incoming numbers or a sliding window.
2.  **Maintain Order Statistics:** Find the k-th smallest/largest element, particularly if the dataset changes.
3.  **Partition Data:** Conceptually divide a set into two halves based on value (smaller/larger).
4.  **Dynamic Datasets:** Handle scenarios where numbers are continuously added or removed (like streams or sliding windows).

Keywords often include: "median", "stream", "sliding window", "k-th element", "partition".

**General Algorithm Steps:**

1.  **Initialization:** Create two heaps: `max_heap` (for the smaller half, stores negative values) and `min_heap` (for the larger half).
2.  **Adding a Number (`num`):**
    -   If `max_heap` is empty or `num <= -max_heap[0]` (i.e., `num` is less than or equal to the largest element in the smaller half), add `-num` to `max_heap`.
    -   Otherwise, add `num` to `min_heap`.
3.  **Balancing the Heaps:** After adding, the heaps might become unbalanced in size. We need to rebalance them. The goal is typically to have:
    -   `len(max_heap) == len(min_heap)` or
    -   `len(max_heap) == len(min_heap) + 1` (We often prefer the max-heap to hold the extra element if the total count is odd).
    -   **If `len(max_heap) > len(min_heap) + 1`:** Move the largest element from `max_heap` (its root) to `min_heap`. Pop `-max_heap[0]` and push `-(heapq.heappop(max_heap))` to `min_heap`.
    -   **If `len(min_heap) > len(max_heap)`:** Move the smallest element from `min_heap` (its root) to `max_heap`. Pop `min_heap[0]` and push `-(heapq.heappop(min_heap))` to `max_heap`.
4.  **Finding the Median:**
    -   **If `len(max_heap) == len(min_heap)`:** The median is `(-max_heap[0] + min_heap[0]) / 2.0`.
    -   **If `len(max_heap) > len(min_heap)`:** The median is `-max_heap[0]`.

**Classic Problem 1: Find Median from Data Stream (LeetCode 295)**

**Problem:** Design a data structure that supports the following two operations:

-   `addNum(int num)` - Add a integer number from the data stream to the data structure.
-   `findMedian()` - Return the median of all elements so far.1

**Why Two Heaps?** We need the median of a continuously growing set of numbers. Sorting the list every time `findMedian` is called would be too slow (O(N log N)). Two heaps allow us to maintain the two halves efficiently and find the median in O(1) time after an O(log N) insertion.

**Python Implementation:**

Python

```
import heapq

class MedianFinder:

    def __init__(self):
        """
        Initialize your data structure here.
        self.small_half_max_heap stores the smaller half (using negation for max-heap behavior)
        self.large_half_min_heap stores the larger half
        """
        self.small_half_max_heap = []  # Stores negative numbers to simulate max-heap
        self.large_half_min_heap = []  # Standard min-heap

    def addNum(self, num: int) -> None:
        """Adds a number into the data structure."""
        # 1. Add the number
        # By default, add to the max_heap (smaller half).
        # If num is larger than the largest in the small half, it might belong
        # to the large half. Or simply add to max_heap first.
        heapq.heappush(self.small_half_max_heap, -num)

        # Make sure the largest element in the small_half_max_heap is <=
        # the smallest element in the large_half_min_heap
        if (self.small_half_max_heap and self.large_half_min_heap and

            val_to_move = -heapq.heappop(self.small_half_max_heap)
            heapq.heappush(self.large_half_min_heap, val_to_move)
        elif len(self.large_half_min_heap) > len(self.small_half_max_heap):
            val_to_move = heapq.heappop(self.large_half_min_heap)
            heapq.heappush(self.small_half_max_heap, -val_to_move)

    def findMedian(self) -> float:
        """Returns the median of current data stream"""
        # Check sizes to determine median calculation
        if len(self.small_half_max_heap) > len(self.large_half_min_heap):
            # Odd number of elements, median is the top of max_heap
            return -self.small_half_max_heap[0]
        elif len(self.large_half_min_heap) > len(self.small_half_max_heap):
             # This case shouldn't happen with our balancing logic, but defensively:
             return self.large_half_min_heap[0]
        else:
            # Even number of elements, median is the average of the two tops
            # Check if heaps are empty first (although problem constraints might prevent this)
            if not self.small_half_max_heap:
                return 0.0 # Or raise error, depending on constraints
            return (-self.small_half_max_heap[0] + self.large_half_min_heap[0]) / 2.0

# Example Usage
# mf = MedianFinder()
# mf.addNum(1)
# mf.addNum(2)
# print(mf.findMedian()) # Output: 1.5
# mf.addNum(3)
# print(mf.findMedian()) # Output: 2.0

```

**Complexity:**

-   `addNum`: O(log N), where N is the total number of elements added so far. Heap push/pop takes logarithmic time.
-   `findMedian`: O(1). Accessing heap tops is constant time.
-   Space Complexity: O(N), to store all the numbers in the heaps.

**Classic Problem 2: Sliding Window Median (LeetCode 480)**

**Problem:** Given an array `nums` and an integer `k`, find the median of each window of size `k` as the window slides from left to right.

**Why Two Heaps?** Similar to the stream median, we need the median of a subset of numbers. However, the subset changes dynamically (sliding window): one element enters, and one element leaves. Two heaps help manage the two halves of the window's elements. The challenge here is efficiently _removing_ an element that slides out of the window. Standard heaps don't support efficient arbitrary removal.

**Approach with Removal Challenge:**

We use the same two-heap structure. Adding the new element is the same as before. Removing the element leaving the window is tricky. A common interview technique is "lazy deletion" or using a hash map to track elements that _should_ be removed but are still physically in the heaps.

1.  **Data Structure:** Two heaps (`max_heap`, `min_heap`) and a hash map (`invalid`) to store counts of elements that have left the window but haven't been physically removed from the heaps yet.
2.  **Sliding:**
    -   For each step, add the new element (`nums[i]`) to the heaps and balance them as in `MedianFinder`.
    -   Increment the count of the element leaving the window (`nums[i-k]`) in the `invalid` map.
    -   **Crucially:** Before calculating the median, clean the tops of the heaps. While the top element of a heap exists in the `invalid` map with a count > 0, pop it from the heap and decrement its count in the map. Repeat until the heap tops are valid elements currently in the window.
    -   Calculate the median using the (now valid) tops of the heaps.

**Python Implementation:**

Python

```
import heapq
from collections import defaultdict

class SlidingWindowMedian:

    def __init__(self):
        self.max_heap = []  # Stores negatives of the smaller half
        self.min_heap = []  # Stores the larger half

    def _add_num(self, num):
        # Add preferentially to max_heap, then balance towards min_heap if needed
        if not self.max_heap or num <= -self.max_heap[0]:
            heapq.heappush(self.max_heap, -num)
        else:
            heapq.heappush(self.min_heap, num)
        self._balance_heaps()

    def _remove_num(self, num):
        # Mark the element as invalid (lazy removal)
        self.invalid_elements[num] += 1

        # Adjust heap balance conceptually. If the element to remove was
        # in max_heap, the max_heap effectively lost an element.

# Example Usage: Note the provided code is a complex implementation attempt.
# Standard library heaps lack efficient removal, making this tricky.
# Simpler problem variations might avoid explicit removal.
# For LeetCode 480, a correct implementation requires careful handling
# of the lazy deletion and balancing logic.

# Example (Conceptual - code requires careful testing/debugging for edge cases)
# solver = SlidingWindowMedian()
# nums1 = [1, 3, -1, -3, 5, 3, 6, 7]
# k1 = 3
# print(solver.medianSlidingWindow(nums1, k1)) # Expected: [1.0, -1.0, -1.0, 3.0, 5.0, 6.0]

# nums2 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 2, 3, 1, 4, 2]
# k2 = 3
# print(SlidingWindowMedian().medianSlidingWindow(nums2, k2)) # Expected: [2.0, 3.0, 3.0, 2.5, 2.0, 3.0, 2.0] # There might be issue in calculation for even K median
                                                            # Let's re-verify median calculation for even k. It should be average.

# Correction on _get_median for even k:
# Ensure heaps are balanced to equal size *after* pruning.
# Then calculate the average. The provided code's balance logic might need refinement.
# The `_get_median` logic seems okay, but the interaction with `_balance_heaps`
# and `_prune_invalid` during the sliding process is the complex part.


```

**Complexity (Sliding Window Median with Lazy Deletion):**

-   Time Complexity: O(N log K), where N is the number of elements in `nums` and K is the window size. Each slide involves one addition (log K), one conceptual removal (O(1) for map update), balancing (log K), and pruning (potentially multiple pops, but amortized O(log K) because each element is pushed and popped at most once).
-   Space Complexity: O(K), for storing elements in the heaps and the hash map for invalid elements.

**Key Takeaways for Two Heaps:**

-   Ideal for median-finding in dynamic sets (streams, sliding windows).
-   Uses a max-heap for the smaller half and a min-heap for the larger half.
-   Requires careful balancing after insertions (and removals in sliding window).
-   Python requires negating values for the max-heap simulation using `heapq`.
-   Removal in sliding windows often requires lazy deletion techniques.
