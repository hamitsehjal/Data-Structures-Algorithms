Topological sorting can be tricky when setting up the problem, especially when dealing with dependencies and prerequisites. Let me help you understand how to structure this problem effectively.

In this build order problem, there are two ways to represent the graph:

1.  **Dependencies representation**: Node → List of nodes it depends on
2.  **Dependents representation**: Node → List of nodes that depend on it

The second approach (dependents) is typically more intuitive for topological sorting because:

-   It directly represents the "comes before" relationship
-   It makes identifying nodes with no prerequisites easier (these are your starting points)
-   It aligns well with the standard topological sort algorithm

Let's break down how to approach this specific problem:

## Step 1: Understand the Input Format

-   Dependencies like (a, d) mean "a must be completed before d"
-   Or in other words, "d depends on a"

## Step 2: Build the Graph

For each dependency (x, y):

-   x is a prerequisite for y
-   y depends on x
-   We add y to the list of nodes dependent on x

```
// Graph structure where each node points to nodes that depend on it
a → [d]
f → [b, a]
b → [d]
d → [c]
e → []  // e has no dependents

```

## Step 3: Track In-Degrees

We also need to track the number of prerequisites (dependencies) each node has:

```
a: 1 (depends on f)
b: 1 (depends on f)
c: 1 (depends on d)
d: 2 (depends on a and b)
e: 0 (no dependencies)
f: 0 (no dependencies)

```

## Step 4: Apply Topological Sort

1.  Start with nodes that have no prerequisites (in-degree = 0): e, f
2.  Process each node, decrementing the in-degree of its dependents
3.  When a node's in-degree becomes 0, add it to the queue

Here's how to implement this solution:

## Why This Structure Works Well

The key insight is understanding which direction the graph edges should point:

1.  When we say (a, d) means "a must be completed before d", in the graph:
    
    -   We add an edge from a → d
    -   But in the adjacency list, we're saying "a has d as a dependent"
2.  This approach makes finding our starting points simple:
    
    -   Nodes with no prerequisites (in-degree = 0) are our starting points
    -   As we process each node, we "remove" it from the graph by decrementing the in-degree of its dependents
3.  The topological sort naturally gives us the correct build order:
    
    -   Start with projects having no dependencies
    -   Gradually include projects as their dependencies are satisfied

## Common Confusion Points

-   The direction of edges might feel reversed from how we think about dependencies
-   Remember that we're building a graph where each node points to what comes after it, not what comes before it
-   The in-degree count is what helps us track prerequisites

When implementing, it helps to think of it as:

-   "Who is waiting for me to finish?" rather than "Who am I waiting for?"
