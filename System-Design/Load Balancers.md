| **Speed / Performance**        | ‚úÖ Faster (lower overhead)                        | ‚ùå Slightly slower (due to inspection/parsing)         |

| **Sticky Sessions**            | ‚ö†Ô∏è Requires IP hash or source port                | ‚úÖ Can use cookies/session data                        |
| **Use Case Example**           | Load balancing TCP services (DB, SMTP, etc.)      | HTTP APIs, Web apps, microservices routing             |
| **Popular Tools**              | HAProxy (L4), AWS NLB, Envoy (L4 mode)            | NGINX, AWS ALB, Traefik, Istio, Envoy (L7 mode)        |

## üîç Quick Summary

-   Use **Layer 4** when you want **fast, protocol-level routing** without inspecting traffic content (e.g., DB connections, low-latency services).
    
-   Use **Layer 7** when you need **smart, content-aware routing** (e.g., API gateway, microservices, user-based routing).

## How would you answer these questions:

1.    Introducing a load balancer into the request-response path adds an additional network hop, which can result in increased latency. How can you reduce this latency?
2. You're architecting a system that needs to handle both HTTP API requests and real-time gaming traffic. How would you design your load balancing strategy? Which types would you use where?
3.  You're building a real-time collaborative document editor (like Google Docs). Users need to see each other's changes instantly. Would you choose stateful or stateless load balancing? What are the trade-offs?
