## üîç Quick Summary

-   Use **Layer 4** when you want **fast, protocol-level routing** without inspecting traffic content (e.g., DB connections, low-latency services).
    
-   Use **Layer 7** when you need **smart, content-aware routing** (e.g., API gateway, microservices, user-based routing).

## How would you answer these questions:

1.    Introducing a load balancer into the request-response path adds an additional network hop, which can result in increased latency. How can you reduce this latency?
2. You're architecting a system that needs to handle both HTTP API requests and real-time gaming traffic. How would you design your load balancing strategy? Which types would you use where?
3.  You're building a real-time collaborative document editor (like Google Docs). Users need to see each other's changes instantly. Would you choose stateful or stateless load balancing? What are the trade-offs?


## Questions:

1. How do you handle the scenario where your DNS directs traffic to a region, but that entire region goes down? What's your fallback mechanism?
If **instant failover** is critical (e.g., live APIs, high-availability systems):
- **Use GSLB + low TTL** for basic resilience
-   **Combine with smart clients** (that can retry or use backup URLs/IPs)
- Or use **Anycast-based routing** (Cloudflare, AWS Global Accelerator) for fastest response
- Keep **server-side health checks** in the GSLB to prevent serving dead IPs to new users

2. how would you design a health check system that can distinguish between a temporary overload vs a genuine server failure? What's your backoff strategy?

- You'd typically use multiple signals - response time percentiles, error rates, and custom health endpoints. Implement exponential backoff for failed nodes and gradual traffic increase when they recover.

3.  If you're using weighted round-robin and one of your high-weight servers starts responding slowly (but not failing health checks), how would your load balancer adapt?
- Modern LBs use real-time metrics like response time moving averages to dynamically adjust weights, not just binary up/down states.
